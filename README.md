# CI/CD-Basics
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are the key practices within the DevOps approach to software development. During continuous integration (CI), developers write code in their local environment and then commit their changes to a shared repository. A testing server then automatically checks the code for any errors that may have occurred during the integration process. Continuous delivery (CD) builds upon continuous integration by automating the process of building, testing, and releasing software with new changes. CD helps to ensure that software can be reliably released whenever it is needed. Deployment servers are used to automate the process of deploying the software to production environments.

Some of the widely used tools for CI/CD include GitLab, Jenkins, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps. These tools  make it easy to implement and keep track of a CI/CD pipeline. They facilitate collaboration between team members, allow for faster delivery of code changes, automate repetitive tasks, and help to detect and fix bugs early in the  Ultimatelty, they help to deliver better software efficiently.
